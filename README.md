3.	The idea of this game is quite simple.
3a.	When you start a new game, you will be given a date at which you are permitted release (from chastity), and a hand of cards.
3b.	Cards can be used to reduce your sentence based on the value of the Poker hand you create with them.
3c.	Cards also come with tasks that further reduce your sentence, if you complete them (you're on the honor system).
3d. You can draw additional cards at regular intervals, choosing the most useful ones to keep and discarding the rest.
3e. There are also Domina cards available. They also have a task associated (listening to certain hypnosis sessions) and if you complete them they will offer additional advantages.
