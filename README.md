2.	My programming abilities are mostly based on learning Scratch when I was still in Junior High. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm learning as I go.
2.1	Furthermore, I am already aware of a dozen things that I could have done differently. But I realize there are possibly smarter people than I around here, so I'm happy for the help.

3.	The idea of this game is quite simple.
	
  *	When you start a new game, you will be given a date at which you are permitted release (from chastity), and a hand of cards.

  *	Cards can be used to reduce your sentence based on the value of the Poker hand you create with them.

  *	Cards also come with tasks that further reduce your sentence, if you complete them (you're on the honor system).

  *	You can draw additional cards at regular intervals, choosing the most useful ones to keep and discarding the rest.

  *	There are also Domina cards available. They also have a task associated (listening to certain hypnosis sessions) and if you complete them they will offer additional advantages.
